+ HTML links, which are also known as hyperlinks, are used to link other web resources to an HTML document, where the resources could be web pages, websites, texts, images, or other types of media ([Gupta, 2021](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-link)).
+ Links can also be used to trigger JavaScript but it is not recommended, because links that do not go anywhere should be replaced by buttons, since that is what the button element is for ([Heilmann, 2019](https://christianheilmann.com/2019/02/05/links-that-dont-go-anywhere-should-be-buttons/)).
