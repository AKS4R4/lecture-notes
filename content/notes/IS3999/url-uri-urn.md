## 1 hyperlink
+ HTML links, which are also known as hyperlinks, are used to link other web resources to an HTML document, where the resources could be web pages, websites, texts, images, or other types of media ([Gupta, 2021](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-link)).
+ Links can also be used to trigger JavaScript but it is not recommended, because links that do not go anywhere should be replaced by buttons, since that is what the button element is for ([Heilmann, 2019](https://christianheilmann.com/2019/02/05/links-that-dont-go-anywhere-should-be-buttons/)).
+ A hyperlink is created using `<a>` element or anchor, which is the most important elements of HTML ([Leverenz, 2023](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/html-element-a--cms-93838a)).


## 2 html tags
+ In a document entitled HTML Tags, there is description of the first 18 HTML tags, `<title>`, `<nextid>`, `<a>`, `<isindex>`, `<plaintext>`, `<listing>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` … `<h6>`, `<address>`, `<hp1>`, `<hp2>` …, `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<menu>` and `<dir>` ([Berners-Lee, 1991](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/tim-berners-lee-published-a-document-called-html-tags-1991)).
+ Today you might have to know about 30 HTML tags in HTML 5 ([MacTavish, 2022](https://medium.com/@zmactavish/30-html-tags-to-know-b0a85b122ded)).
+ Supports of tags for image, and audio & video are added in different version of HTML as the history tells ([Prasad, 2022](https://computerstudypoint.com/what-is-the-history-of-html/?expand_article=1)).
