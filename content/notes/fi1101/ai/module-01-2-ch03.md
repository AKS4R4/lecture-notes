## 3-1 Vectors and Their Components (1 of 15)
Learning Objectives
+ 3.01 Add vectors by drawing them in head-to-tail arrangements, applying the commutative and associative laws.
+ 3.02 Subtract a vector from a second one.
+ 3.03 Calculate the components of a vector on a given coordinate system, showing them in a drawing.
+ 3.04 Given the components of a vector, draw the vector and determine its magnitude and orientation.
+ 3.05 Convert angle measures between degrees and radians.

## 3-1 Vectors and Their Components (2 of 15)
+ Physics deals with quantities that have both size and direction
+ A vector is a mathematical object with size and direction
+ A vector quantity is a quantity that can be represented by a vector
  - Examples: position, velocity, acceleration
  - Vectors have their own rules for manipulation
+ A scalar is a quantity that does not have a direction
  - Examples: time, temperature, energy, mass
  - Scalars are manipulated with ordinary algebra
