## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.01 Identify that if all parts of an object move in the same direction at the same
rate, we can treat it as a (point-like) particle.
+ 2.02 Identify that the position of a particle is its location on a scaled axis.
+ 2.03 Apply the relationship between a particle's displacement and its initial and
final positions.
+ 2.04 Apply the relationship between a particle's average velocity, its
displacement, and the time interval.
+ 2.05 Apply the relationship between a particle's average speed, the total distance
it moves, and the time interval.
+ 2.06 Given a graph of a particle's position versus time, determine the average
velocity between two times.


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (2 of 9)
+ Kinematics is the classification and comparison of motions
+ For this chapter, we restrict motion in three ways:
  1. We consider motion along a straight line only
  2. We discuss only the motion itself, not the forces that cause it
  3. We consider the moving object to be a particle
+ A particle is either:
  - A point-like object (such as an electron)
  - Or an object that moves such that each part travels in the same
direction at the same rate (no rotation or stretching)


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (3 of 9)
+ Position is measured relative to a reference point:
  - The origin, or zero point, of an axis
+ Position has a sign:
  - Positive direction is in the direction of increasing numbers
  - Negative direction is opposite the positive

+ A change in position is called displacement
  - $\Delta x$ is the change in $x$, (final position) − (initial position)
$$\tag{2-1}
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1
$$
+ Examples A particle moves . . .
  - From x = 5 m to x = 12 m: $\Delta x = 7$ m (positive direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 1 m:  $\Delta x = -4$ m (negative direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 200 m to x = 5 m: $\Delta x = 0$ m.
+ The actual distance covered is irrelevant

+ Displacement is therefore a vector quantity
  - Direction: along a single axis, given by sign (+ or −)
  - Magnitude: length or distance, in this case meters or feet
+ Ignoring sign, we get its magnitude (absolute value)
  - The magnitude of $\Delta x = -4$ m is 4 m.
+ Checkpoint 1 \
  Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis. Which pairs give a negative displacement: \
  (a) −3 m, +5 m; (b) −3 m, −7 m; (c) 7 m, −3 m?
+ Answer: pairs (b) and (c) \
(b) −7 m − (−3) m = −4 m \
(c) −3 m − 7 m = −10 m


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (6 of 9)
+ Average velocity is the ratio of:
  - A displacement, Δx
  - To the time interval in which the displacement occurred, Δt
$$\tag{2-2}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac{Δx}{Δt} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$
+ Average velocity has units of $\displaystyle \frac{(\rm distance)}{(\rm time)}$
  - Meters per second, m/s
  
  
## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (7 of 9)
+ On a graph of x vs. t, the average velocity is the slope of the
straight line that connects two points
+ Average velocity is therefore a vector quantity
  - Positive slope means positive average velocity
  - Negative slope means negative average velocity

Figure 2-4

+ This is a graph of position $x$ versus time $t$.
+ To find average velocity, first draw a straight line, start to end, and then find the slope of the line.
  - This vertical distance is how far it moved, start to end: $\Delta x$ = 2 m - (-4 m) = 6 m
  - This horizontal distance is how long it took, start to end: $\Delta t$ = 4 s - 1 s = 3 s
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
v_{\rm avg} & = & {\rm slope \ of \ this \ line} \newline
& = & \displaystyle \frac{\rm rise}{\rm run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
\end{array}
$$


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (9 of 9)
+ Average speed is the ratio of:
  - The total distance covered
  - To the time interval in which the distance was covered, ∆t
$$\tag{2-3}
s_{\rm avg} = \frac{\rm total \ distance}{Δt}
$$
+ Average speed is always positive (no direction) \
Example A particle moves from x = 3 m to x = −3 m in 2 seconds.
  - Average velocity = −3 m/s; average speed = 3 m/s
