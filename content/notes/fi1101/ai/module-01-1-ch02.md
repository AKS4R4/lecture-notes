## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.01 Identify that if all parts of an object move in the same direction at the same
rate, we can treat it as a (point-like) particle.
+ 2.02 Identify that the position of a particle is its location on a scaled axis.
+ 2.03 Apply the relationship between a particle's displacement and its initial and
final positions.
+ 2.04 Apply the relationship between a particle's average velocity, its
displacement, and the time interval.
+ 2.05 Apply the relationship between a particle's average speed, the total distance
it moves, and the time interval.
+ 2.06 Given a graph of a particle's position versus time, determine the average
velocity between two times.


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (2 of 9)
+ Kinematics is the classification and comparison of motions
+ For this chapter, we restrict motion in three ways:
  1. We consider motion along a straight line only
  2. We discuss only the motion itself, not the forces that cause it
  3. We consider the moving object to be a particle
+ A particle is either:
  - A point-like object (such as an electron)
  - Or an object that moves such that each part travels in the same
direction at the same rate (no rotation or stretching)


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (3 of 9)
+ Position is measured relative to a reference point:
  - The origin, or zero point, of an axis
+ Position has a sign:
  - Positive direction is in the direction of increasing numbers
  - Negative direction is opposite the positive

Figure 2-1


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (4 of 9)
+ A change in position is called displacement
  - $\Delta x$ is the change in $x$, (final position) − (initial position)
$$\tag{2-1}
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1
$$
+ Examples A particle moves . . .
  - From x = 5 m to x = 12 m: $\Delta x = 7$ m (positive direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 1 m:  $\Delta x = -4$ m (negative direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 200 m to x = 5 m: $\Delta x = 0$ m.
+ The actual distance covered is irrelevant


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (5 of 9)
+ Displacement is therefore a vector quantity
  - Direction: along a single axis, given by sign (+ or −)
  - Magnitude: length or distance, in this case meters or feet
+ Ignoring sign, we get its magnitude (absolute value)
  - The magnitude of $\Delta x = -4$ m is 4 m.
+ Checkpoint 1 \
  Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis. Which pairs give a negative displacement: \
  (a) −3 m, +5 m; (b) −3 m, −7 m; (c) 7 m, −3 m?
+ Answer: pairs (b) and (c) \
(b) −7 m − (−3) m = −4 m \
(c) −3 m − 7 m = −10 m


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (6 of 9)
+ Average velocity is the ratio of:
  - A displacement, Δx
  - To the time interval in which the displacement occurred, Δt
$$\tag{2-2}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac{Δx}{Δt} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$
+ Average velocity has units of $\displaystyle \frac{(\rm distance)}{(\rm time)}$
  - Meters per second, m/s
  
  
## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (7 of 9)
+ On a graph of x vs. t, the average velocity is the slope of the
straight line that connects two points
+ Average velocity is therefore a vector quantity
  - Positive slope means positive average velocity
  - Negative slope means negative average velocity

Figure 2-4

+ This is a graph of position $x$ versus time $t$.
+ To find average velocity, first draw a straight line, start to end, and then find the slope of the line.
  - This vertical distance is how far it moved, start to end: $\Delta x$ = 2 m - (-4 m) = 6 m
  - This horizontal distance is how long it took, start to end: $\Delta t$ = 4 s - 1 s = 3 s
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
v_{\rm avg} & = & {\rm slope \ of \ this \ line} \newline
& = & \displaystyle \frac{\rm rise}{\rm run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
\end{array}
$$


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (9 of 9)
+ Average speed is the ratio of:
  - The total distance covered
  - To the time interval in which the distance was covered, ∆t
$$\tag{2-3}
s_{\rm avg} = \frac{\rm total \ distance}{Δt}
$$
+ Average speed is always positive (no direction) \
Example A particle moves from x = 3 m to x = −3 m in 2 seconds.
  - Average velocity = −3 m/s; average speed = 3 m/s


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.07 Given a particle's position as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous velocity for any particular time.
+ 2.08 Given a graph of a particle's position versus time, determine
the instantaneous velocity for any particular time.
+ 2.09 Identify speed as the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (2 of 7)
+ Average measurement assume that the velocity is always the
same for the given time interval.

## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (3 of 7)
+ To obtained a better measurement, take smaller time interval
> Seperti grafik sebelumnya dengan tambahan $t_3$, $t_1 < t_3 < t_2$.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (4 of 7)
+ To obtained a better measurement, take smaller time interval.
> Seperti grafik sebelumnya dengan tanpa $t_3$ dan garis lurus menjadi garis singgung di titik $t_2$.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (5 of 7)
+ Instantaneous velocity, or just velocity, $v$, is:
  - At a single moment in time
  - Obtained from average velocity by shrinking $\Delta t$
  - The slope of the position-time curve for a particle at an instant (the derivative of position)
  - A vector quantity with units $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (distance)}{\rm (time)}$
    * The sign of the velocity represents its direction
$$\tag{2-4}
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (6 of 7)
+ Speed is the magnitude of (instantaneous) velocity

Example A velocity of 5 m/s and −5 m/s both have an associated speed of 5 m/s. \
Checkpoint 2 \
The following equations give the position $x(t)$ of a particle in four situations
(in each equation, $x$ is in meters, $t$ is in seconds, and $t > 0$): (1) $x = 3t - 2$; (2) $x = -4t^2 - 2$; (3) $\displaystyle x = \frac{2}{t^2}$; and (4) $x = -2$. (a) In which situation is the velocity $v$ of the particle constant? (b) In which is $v$ in the negative x direction? \
Answers: \
(a) Situations 1 and 4 (zero) \
(b) Situations 2 and 3


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (7 of 7)
Example
+ The graph shows the position and velocity of an elevator cab over time.
+ The slope of $x(t)$, and so also the velocity $v$, is zero from 0 to 1 s, and from 9 s on.
+ During the interval bc, the slope is constant and nonzero, so the cab moves with constant velocity (4 m/s).

## 2-3 Acceleration (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.10 Apply the relationship between a particle's average
acceleration, its change in velocity, and the time interval for
that change.
+ 2.11 Given a particle's velocity as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous acceleration for any particular time.
+ 2.12 Given a graph of a particle's velocity versus time, determine
the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time and the
average acceleration between any two particular times.


## 2-3 Acceleration (2 of 7)
+ A change in a particle's velocity is acceleration
+ Average acceleration over a time interval
$$\tag{2-7}
a_{\rm avg} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
+ Instantaneous acceleration (or just acceleration), $a$, for a
single moment in time is:
  - Slope of velocity vs. time graph
$$\tag{2-8}
a = \frac{dv}{dt}
$$


## 2-3 Acceleration (3 of 7)
+ Combining Equations (2-8) and (2-4):
$$\tag{2-9}
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
$$
+ Acceleration is a vector quantity:
  + Positive sign means in the positive coordinate direction
  + Negative sign means the opposite
  + Units of $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (distance)}{\rm (time \ squared)}$


## 2-3 Acceleration (4 of 7)
If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle
are the same, the speed of the particle increases. If the
signs are opposite, the speed decreases.


## 2-3 Acceleration (5 of 7)
Example If a car with velocity $v$ = −25 m/s is braked to a stop in 5.0 s, then  $a$ = +5.0 m/s . Acceleration is positive, but speed has decreased.
+ Note: accelerations can be expressed in units of g
$$\tag{2-10}
1g = 9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2} \ (g \ {\rm unit})
$$


## 2-3 Acceleration (6 of 7)
Checkpoint 3 \
A wombat moves along an $x$ axis. What is the sign of its acceleration if it is moving (a) in the positive direction with increasing speed, (b) in the positive direction with decreasing speed, (c) in the negative direction with increasing speed, and (d) in the negative direction with decreasing speed?

Answers: \
(a) + \
(b) − \
(c) − \
(d) +


## 2-3 Acceleration (7 of 7)
Example
+ The graph shows the velocity and acceleration of an elevator cab over
time.
+ When acceleration is 0 (e.g. interval bc) velocity is constant.
+ When acceleration is positive (ab) upward velocity increases.
+ When acceleration is negative (cd) upward velocity decreases.
+ Steeper slope of the velocity-time graph indicates a larger magnitude of
acceleration: the cab stops in half the time it takes to get up to speed.

## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.13 For constant acceleration, apply the relationships between
position, velocity, acceleration, and elapsed time (Table 2-1).
+ 2.14 Calculate a particle's change in velocity by integrating its
acceleration function with respect to time.
+ 2.15 Calculate a particle's change in position by integrating its
velocity function with respect to time.


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (2 of 8)
+ In many cases acceleration is constant, or nearly so.
+ For these cases, 5 special equations can be used.
+ Note that constant acceleration means a velocity with a constant slope, and a
position with varying slope (unless $a = 0$).

## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (3 of 8)
+ First basic equation
  - When the acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal
  - Rewrite Eq. (2-7) and rearrange
$$\tag{2-11}
a = a_{\rm avg} = \frac{v - v_0}{t - 0}, \ \ \ \ v = v_0 + at
$$
+ This equation reduces to $v = v_0$ for t = 0
+ Its derivative yields the definition of $a$, $\displaystyle \frac{dv}{dt}$


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (4 of 8)
+ Second basic equation
  - Rewrite Equation (2-2) and rearrange
$$\tag{2-12}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac{x - x_0}{t- 0}, \ \ \ \ x = x_0 + v_{\rm avg} t
$$
+ Average = $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (initial) + (final) }{2}$
$$\tag{2-13}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac12(v_0 + v)
$$
+ Substitute (2-11) to (2-13)


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (5 of 8)
$$\tag{2-14}
v_{\rm avg} = v_0 + \frac12 at
$$
+ Substitute (2-14) into (2-12)
$$\tag{2-15}
x - x_0 = v_0 t + \frac12 at^2
$$


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (6 of 8)
+ These two equations can be obtained by integrating a constant
acceleration
+ Enough to solve any constant acceleration problem
  - Solve as simultaneous equations
+ Additional useful forms:
$$\tag{2-16}
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)
$$

$$\tag{2-17}
x - x_0 = \frac12 (v_0 + v) t
$$

$$\tag{2-18}
x - x_0 = vt - \frac12 at^2
$$

Checkpoint 4 \
The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four
situations: (1) $x = 3t - 4$; (2) $x = -5t^3 + 4t^2 + 6$; (3) $\displaystyle x = \frac{2}{t^2} - \frac{4}{t}$; (4) $x = 5t^2 - 3$.

To which of these situations do the equations of Table 2-1 apply?

Answer: \
