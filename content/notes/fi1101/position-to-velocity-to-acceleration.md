Essence of calculus is derivative, that is the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables, which is equivalent to finding the slope of the tangent line to the function at a point ([Watkins et al., 1999](https://web.mit.edu/wwmath/calculus/differentiation/definition.html)). Position, change of position, and various rates of change of position are referred as kinematic variables, where the terms kinematics means the study of motion, from the Greek word for movement, kinesis ([Redish, 2019](https://www.compadre.org/nexusph/course/Kinematic_variables)). If position is something as function of time, the first derivative gives its velocity, and the second derivative gives its acceleration, or simply differentiate position to get velocity and further differentiate velocity to get acceleration ([Zegarelli, 2021](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/math/calculus/how-to-analyze-position-velocity-and-acceleration-with-differentiation-188086/)), where the derivative means derivative with respect to time.


## position and its derivatives
Suppose that there is position as function of time t in 3-d
