As a mathematical branch of physics, kinematics uses equations to describe motion of objects, specifically objects' trajectories, without referring the forces that cause it ([Beck, 2020](https://sciencing.com/free-fall-physics-definition-formula-problems-solutions-w-examples-13720232.html)). One way to study it is by performing various simple experiments ([Carolina, 2010](https://www.uvm.edu/~ldonfort/P21S20/2_Kinematics.pdf)). Estimating motion of vehicles at intersections is one of kinematics application ([Ahn & Kim, 2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916442)).
