In many daily situations we can see parabolic motion, which is involving many factors such as gravity, velocity, acceleration, and time, where mathematics puts all in formulas explaining how it is formed and and continues ([Lincoln, 2020](https://www.wondriumdaily.com/mathematics-of-falling-the-parabolic-movement/)). Two laws must be known in order to derive the parabolic trajectory of the motion, where one is the law of free fall and the other is restricted principle of inertia, as Galileo discovered the motion as a case of serendipity ([Drake & MacLachlan, 1975](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24949756)). Two of features that are sometimes dicussed from the motion are maximum height and range ([Boundless, 2018](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_Physics_(Boundless)/3%3A_Two-Dimensional_Kinematics/3.3%3A_Projectile_Motion)). There are animation showing the superposition of uniform and non-uniform linear motions ([Henderson, 2022](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/vectors/bds.cfm)), calculator to find maximum height and range accompanied with their times ([Had2Know, 2023](https://www.had2know.org/academics/trajectory-parabola-equations-calculator.html)), and interactive visualisation with adjustable parameters to show the influence of factors to the trajectory ([Desmos, 2023](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6avipsmfhm)). And it is also interesting that there is observation of perceptual judgments of duraction of parabolic motions in virtual reality world ([JÃ¶rges et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86428-3)). Sometimes it is assumed to be the same as free fall motion ([Kumar, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3R2sZLJUhI)), which is actually not ([Albert, 2023](https://www.albert.io/blog/free-fall-motion)). Here equation of trajectory, usually as y = f(x), is derived from two parametric equations representing uniform linear motion in x direction and non-uniform linear motion in y direction.
